Connect Four README
===================

1.	What is it about
Here you can find a complete code for the Connect Four (A four in row) game for Windows Phone

2.	Can I play?
Yes. Build, install and play.

It supports two modes:
- Human vs human
- Human vs. bot

and uses a board of classic size, namely 6 rows and 7 columns.

3. How aestetic is it?
The UI-part of the game is definitely not its strongest part, but you will be 
capable to play the game. To do it, just click on the colored bars, which 
symbolize columns.

4. What phone do I need to run it?
Any that runs Windows Phone 8.1. I used an emulator in order to develop and 
test it, so the game is not in the Windows Store. In order to run it, 
you will have to build it on your own. If you don’t know how, here is a good 
point to start: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19982053/how-do-i-add-an-existing-solution-to-github-from-visual-studio-2013

5. What is the "bot mode"?
A couple of notes on “AI”. Surely, there is no “I” in my version. I was told 
not to mess with the winning algorithm, so the bot plays like an imbecile. 
It places chips just around the last human move. Don't expect too much. 

6. How much time it took?
~ 8hrs pure time. 

7. Is there something worth looking in the code?
Don't know. Binding of controls, use of models, navigation, passing parameters  
won't add anything to your knowledge. The game itself? ;)
